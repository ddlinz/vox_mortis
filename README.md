#### A Basic Application for downloadloading playlists and creating a streaming radio ###

The general outline of the application 
1. syncronize a series of platlits on YouTube and Odysee with a hard drive
2. tag each of the hard drive files based on their origin
3. create a randomized selected playlist from the files and play 
4. stream to a specified address through something like OBS

The overall prject should be to create a randomized webradio that I can listen to while I work, or that can be turned into a web-radio with comments on any service that allows for media streaming.
